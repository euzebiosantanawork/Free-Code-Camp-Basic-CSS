/*

Add the CSS property flex to both #box-1 and #box-2. 
Give #box-1 the values so its flex-grow is 2, its 
flex-shrink is 2, and its flex-basis is 150px.
Give #box-2 the values so its flex-grow is 1,
its flex-shrink is 1, and its flex-basis is 150px.

These values will cause #box-1 to grow to fill the 
extra space at twice the rate of #box-2 when the 
container is greater than 300px and shrink at twice
the rate of #box-2 when the container is less than
300px. 300px is the combined size of the flex-basis
values of the two boxes.
