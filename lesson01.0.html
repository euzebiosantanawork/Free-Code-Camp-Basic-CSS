/* Welcome to freeCodeCamp`s HTML coding challenges. Thse will walk you through web development step-by-step.

First, you`ll start by buiding a simple web page using HTML. You can edit code in your code editor, which is embedded into this
web page.

Do you see the code in your code editor that says <h1>Hello</h1> ? That`s an HTML element.

Most html elements have an opening tag and closing tag:

Opening tags look like this:
*/
<h1>
//Closing tags look like thi:
</h1>

/*
The  only diference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag.

Each challenge has test you can run at any time by clicking the "Runtest" button, When you pass all test, you'll be 
prompted to submit your solution and go to the next coding challenge.
