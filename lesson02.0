Over the next few lessosns, we`ll build an HTML5 cat photo web app piece-by-piece

The h2 element you will be adding in this step will add a level two headding to the web page.

This element tells the browser about the structure of website, h1 elements are often used for main headings, while h2
elements are generally used for subhheadings. There are also h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements to indicate different levels of
subheadings.

Add an h2 tag that says "CatPhotoApp" to create a second HTML elements below your "Hello World" h1 element.
